## Lab Instructions: Running Ansible Playbook on a Windows Host

In this lab, you will learn how to use Ansible to manage Windows hosts using the WinRM protocol. You will use a sample playbook to perform some basic tasks on a Windows host.

### Prerequisites

1. An Ansible control node set up on a Linux machine with Ansible 2.10 or later installed.

2. A Windows host with WinRM configured and enabled. Ensure that the Ansible control node can communicate with the Windows host via WinRM.

3. A user account on the Windows host with administrative privileges. The user account should have a strong password, and you should have the credentials for the account.


### Setting up the Inventory File
Perform the following steps on the Windows Host in VS Code
In the VS Code Explorer pane:

1. Right Click the `ansible-working` repo in the explorer pane

2. Select `New File`

3. Enter the name and content details below:

4. Create a new file named `inventory_groups.yml` and open it in your preferred text editor.

5. Define the Windows host details in the inventory file in the following format:

   ```
   all:
     children:
       linux:
         hosts:
           ansible_controller:
             ansible_host: <ip address provided for Ubuntu VM>
       windows:
         children:
            webservers:
               hosts:
                 windows_server1:
                   ansible_host: <ip address provided for Windows VM>
  
   ```
   Replace `<ip address provided>` with the IP address of the Ansible host and Windows host provided to you.
   
   > Notice that this inventory file expects that the variable for windows host connections will be passed in by the playbook

   Note: If your Windows host is on a domain, you can use the `ansible_domain_username` and `ansible_domain_password` parameters instead of `ansible_user` and `ansible_password`.

### Running the Ansible Playbook
In the VS Code Explorer pane:

1. Right Click in the explorer pane
1. Select `New Folder`
1. Create a new folder named `playbook-fun`
1. in the explorer view expand the `ansible-windows-best` folder and expand the `labs/playbook-fun`
1. While holding down the ctrl key drag the `files` folder and drop it on the `ansible-working/playbook-fun` folder created in the previous step to copy the folder and its contents.
1. Right Click in the explorer pane
1. Select 'New File'
1. Enter `playbook.yml` as the name:
1. Copy the following YAML code to the `playbook.yml` file:

   ```
   ---
   - name: Ensure IIS is installed and started 
     hosts: webservers
     vars:
       ansible_connection: winrm
       ansible_winrm_transport: ntlm
       ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
       ansible_user: Administrator
       ansible_password: JustM300
       service_name: IIS Admin Service   
     tasks:
       - name: Ensure IIS Server is present 
         win_feature:
           name:  Web-Server
           state: present
           restart: no
           include_sub_features: yes
           include_management_tools: yes  
       - name: Ensure latest web files are present
         win_copy:
           src: playbook-fun/files/
           dest: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
           force: yes
       - name: Ensure IIS is started
   {% raw %}
         win_service:
           name: "{{ service_name }}"
           state: started
   {% endraw %}
   ```
   
This playbook contains three tasks that ensure IIS is present, copies web files to the `wwwroot` folder then confirms the `IIS Admin` service is running.

Update the `ansible.cfg` to set the new `inventory_groups.yml` as the default inventory file

1. In VS Code on the Explorer pane open the `ansible.cfg` file in the root of the `ansible-working` repo
2. update the inventory path as below:

```
[defaults]
INVENTORY = inventory_groups.yml
```
Save all files

### Commit and Push Changes to GitHub

1. In the sidebar, click on the "Source Control" icon (it looks like a branch).
2. In the "Source Control" pane, review the changes you made to the file.
3. Enter a commit message that describes the changes you made.
4. Click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.
5. Click on the "..." menu in the "Source Control" pane, and select "Push" to push the changes to GitHub.

## Update the Ansible Control Host

1. Return to the connection to your Ansible control host in PuTTY on the Windows host.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned repository.
3. Run `git pull` to update the repository on the control host.
5. Run the playbook using the following command:

## Run the Playbook

since we have specified the `inventory_groups.yml` inventory file as our default in `ansible.cfg` we dont need to specify `-i inventory_groups.yml` when running our playbook Instead of running `ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml` we can simply run `ansible-playbook playbook.yml`

   ```
   ansible-playbook playbook.yml
   ```

   This command will run the `playbook.yml` playbook against the Windows host defined in the `inventory.yml` file.

   Verify that the playbook has run successfully by checking the output in the console.
   
   You can also open Chrome and navigate to `http://<ip address provided for windows host>`
   
   You should see Hello, World! because you can't have a code demo without at least one Hello, World.

Congratulations! You have successfully run an Ansible playbook on a Windows host.

### Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to use Ansible to manage Windows hosts using the WinRM protocol. You used a sample playbook to perform some basic tasks on a Windows host. You also learned how to set up an inventory file with the Windows host details and run the playbook against the host.

Now that you have the basic understanding of how to use Ansible with Windows hosts, you can explore more advanced use cases and features to automate and manage your Windows infrastructure.
